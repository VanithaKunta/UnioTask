# UnioTask

1. Create a sign up page with username and password.
2. The user values must be entered into the database.
3. Next time when a user signs up the fields must be overwritten in the database.

Ex: A user signed up using "user1" and "user123" values.
    The values in database are 1. user1 and user123.
    When a second user signs up using "user2" and "user1234",
      the fields must be updated in the database.
      Hence the values in database should be 1. user2 and user1234.
